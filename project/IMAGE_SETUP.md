I've successfully added image functionality to your birthday website! Here's what I've implemented:

### âœ… New Components Created

## ðŸ“¸ How to Add Pragyesh's Image

### Step 1: Get the Image
- Find a good photo of Pragyesh Kumar Seth

- Minimum 400x400 pixels recommended

### Step 2: Add to Project
1. Copy the image file
2. Paste it in the `public/images/` folder

The website will automatically display the image in:

The images are automatically styled with:
